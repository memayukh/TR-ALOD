# In this folder you'll find 2 .xlsx files for each of the 8 datasets
The naming convention of the xlsx file are as follows:

1. UnS_DatasetName_new: The _"UnS"_ refers to the Uncertainty Sampling we used in our current work. The _"new"_ refers to the TR-ALOD algorithm.
2. UnS_DatasetName_old: The _"UnS"_ refers to the Uncertainty Sampling we used in our current work. The _"old"_ refers to the ALOD-RE algorithm that we used in previous work [2].
